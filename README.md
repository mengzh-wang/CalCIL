# Berkeley Computational Imaging Library (CalCIL)
Goal in a sentence: Write image reconstruction completely on a Jupyter notebook, and the notebook remains pleasant to open and read. 

## Describe the library 

## Pending features:
- [x] Gradient-based iterative reconstruction
- [ ] forward.Model class implementation
- [ ] Refactor data loader
- [ ] Migrate wave optics common functions
- [ ] Multi-GPU support via pmap
- [ ] Example notebooks
- [ ] Non-gradient descent optimization supports
- [ ] Helper functions to read & search & manipulate variables dict
- [ ] Store the forward model (incl. parameters, functions) in a file, recover the forward model without its definition code?
- [ ] Populate unit testing
