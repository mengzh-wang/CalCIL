# Berkeley Computational Imaging Library (CalCIL)

This project aims to provide a set of ubiquitous and reliable APIs for the general purpose computational imaging reconstructions. 

## Work in progress
This library is in progress. 

## Installation
CaiCIL is built upon [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) ecosystem. The core functionalities depend on Numpy, [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax), [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax), and [Optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax). The logging in the reconstruction process requires Tensorflow V2.
